# PythonLearning-100Days

Welcome to my 100 Days of Python Learning journey! This repository serves as a log of my progress, projects, notes, and code snippets as I dedicate time each day to learning and mastering Python.

## üéØ Goals

Over the next 100 days, I aim to:

- Achieve a strong understanding of Python fundamentals (syntax, data structures, OOP, etc.).
- Explore key Python libraries and frameworks relevant to my interests (e.g., web development, data science, automation).
- Complete daily coding exercises and small projects to solidify my learning.
- Develop a consistent coding habit and problem-solving skills.
- Document my journey, challenges, and breakthroughs.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by day. Each day's work will be in a separate folder:

```
/Day001
/Day002
/Day003
...
/Day100
```

Inside each `DayXXX` folder, you might find:

- `notes.md`: A summary of topics covered, key takeaways, and reflections.
- `*.py` files: Python scripts with examples, exercises, or mini-projects.
- `resources/`: Links to articles, tutorials, or documentation used.

## üöÄ Getting Started

If you'd like to follow along or run some of the code:

1.  **Clone the repository (optional):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bhimonw/PythonLearning-100Days.git
    cd PythonLearning-100Days
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a specific day's folder:**
    ```bash
    cd Day00X
    ```
3.  **Ensure you have Python installed:**
    If not, download it from python.org.
4.  **Run Python scripts:**
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

- **Python 3.x**
- (Potentially others as I progress, e.g., VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks, Git)

## üí° My Learning Plan (High-Level)
