## 🎯 Goals

Over the next 100 days, I aim to:

- Build a strong understanding of Python fundamentals (syntax, data structures, OOP, etc.).
- Explore libraries and frameworks relevant to my interests (web development, data science, automation).
- Complete daily coding exercises and mini-projects to solidify my learning.
- Develop a consistent coding habit and problem-solving mindset.
- Document my journey, challenges, and breakthroughs.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository is organized into one folder per day:

```

/Day001
/Day002
/Day003
...
/Day100

````

Each folder may contain:

- `notes.md`: Summary of topics learned, key takeaways, reflections.
- `.py` files: Example scripts, mini-challenges, or practice exercises.
- `resources/`: Optional — links, images, or materials used.
